### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. In this assignment I learned about the DOM, or Document Object Model, a tree model
of the web page created by the browser when the page loads.
2. I also learned about the DOM eventlistener function, which allows an event handler 
to be attached to a specified element, and that it can be used multiple times in a 
document, even used mutliple times on one element.
3. I also learned about DOM nodes, which are the basic HTML elements of the tree structure.
